[Medium Post](https://medium.com/@aykutarslantas/building-a-lightweight-php-framework-from-scratch-f47c4d398576 "Medium") by [Aykut ARSLANTAÅž]


Welcome to the official repository of our custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. This framework is designed to provide a foundation for building web applications using PHP. In this repository, you will find the complete source code and instructions for setting up and using the framework. The framework is well-documented in the accompanying Medium post, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/@aykutarslantas/building-a-lightweight-php-framework-from-scratch-f47c4d398576).

## Features

- Lightweight and easy to understand.
- Follows the MVC architectural pattern.
- URL routing for clean and SEO-friendly URLs.
- Autoloading of classes for efficient code organization.
- Sample controllers and views to help you get started.
- Customizable and extendable for your projects.

## Getting Started

To start using our MVC framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```shel
git clone https://github.com/aykutarslantas/HowCanBuildYourMVCFramework.git
```
Configure your web server to point to the public directory as the document root.

Update the framework's configuration files in the app/config directory as needed.

Refer to the Medium post for detailed instructions on creating controllers, views, and routes.

Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to create a controller and route in our MVC framework:

```php
// Create a new controller class
class MyController extends \Core\Controller
{
    public function indexAction()
    {
        \Core\View::render('my-view', ['data' => 'Hello, World!']);
    }
}
```

```php
// Define a route index.php
$router->add('my-route', ['controller' => 'MyController', 'action' => 'index']);
```
